<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</span>In the JaredAll/Tetris implementation, the Factory design pattern is used to instantiate the different Tetris pieces. Each of the seven different piece types extend the abstract <code>TetrisPiece</code> class. This class is used to manipulate a Tetris piece of arbitrary type throughout the rest of the code. For almost all operations, it doesn't matter on which specific piece the operation is performed; for example, all pieces can be shifted, rotated, and dropped the same way.&nbsp;</p>

The color of the piece is handled by configurations in the <code>TetrisComponentFactory</code>, and the block configurations unique to each piece type are to be defined in the virtual <code>original_block_locations()</code> method. This method, implemented in each of the subclasses of <code>TetrisPiece</code>, is called in the constructor of each <code>TetrisPiece</code> implementation to initialize the relationship between the block locations. This relationship is preserved by the operations in the <code>TetrisPiece</code> super class.</div><div><br /></div><div><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</span>The <code>TetrisComponentFactory</code> is responsible for instantiating the different implementations of <code>TetrisPiece</code>, and does so by consulting an enum value passed in as a parameter to the build_component method. However, after piece creation, there is no need to treat the different implementations of <code>TetrisPiece</code> differently. So, the build_component method returns a <code>unique_ptr&lt;TetrisPiece&gt;</code>, ready to be rotated, shifted, and dropped by the player.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</span>The source code for the JaredAll/Tetris implementation can be found
