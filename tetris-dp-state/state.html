<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</span>A tetris piece may find
itself in several different situations. The most common is that of a
delayed free fall. The piece hangs suspended; periodically, it will
fall one blocks worth of space, there to reside until it is time to
fall again. At any point in its slow descent, the piece may be
rotated, shifted horizontally, or dropped to the bottom of the
board. Any horizontal shift must incur one block's worth of additional
progress toward its bitter teleological end, but a rotation must
not. How can a Tetris piece keep track of its current situation and
ensure that the necessary operations are performed given some user
input? Furthermore, how can we maintain the implementation of these
situations so that their logic is kept separate? In <i>Game
Programming Patterns</i>, Robert Nystrom presents an object-oriented
state machine as a solution. That approach has been implemented in
JaredAll/Tetris.<div><br /><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;</span>The <code>TetrisPiece</code> maintains information about
its current state in a reference to the
abstract <code>TetrisPieceState</code> class. Each time the piece is
updated, it delegates updating its own instance variables to that
state object. It also replaces its current state object with one
returned by the call to <code>state -&gt;
update()</code>. The <code>update()</code> method is virtual
in <code>TetrisPieceState</code>; each implementation is responsible
for keeping track of which implementation the piece should have
next. On handling an input event, the piece calls the
state's <code>update(InputEvent&amp; event)</code> method. This method
is implemented in the <code>TetrisPieceState</code> abstract class,
and orchestrates which state should come next based upon the input. In
order to do so correctly, it must be able to obtain which state would
come next in the event that the input is erroneous (such input will be
ignored, so the piece must resume as though the input didn't
occur). To do so, the <code>TetrisPieceState</code> declares the
virtual <code>determine_next_state()</code> method, in which each
implementation calculates which state will come next.</div><div><br /><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;

consider a piece that has accepted user input requesting that it shift
to the right. The <code>update(InputEvent&amp; event)</code> is called by
the piece. That update method returns an instance
of <code>ShiftingState</code>, which updates the piece's current
position in the board. Since each horizontal shift requires that the
piece also fall, <code>ShiftingState</code>'s implementation of
update returns an instance of <code>FallingState</code>. On the next
call to <code>update()</code>, the piece's vertical position is
updated. After falling, the waiting period for the slow descent is
reset, so the <code>FallingState</code> returns an instance
of <code>WaitingState</code>. However, this scenario is only possible
if the piece can in fact shift to the right. If it cannot,
the <code>update(InputEvent&amp; event)</code> method returns the same
state that its implementation would, by delegating to the
implementation through the virtual <code>determine_next_state()</code>
method. Throughout theses interactions, the <code>TetrisPiece</code>
is unaware of the implementation of its current state and can simply
call update through its pointer to the
abstract <code>TetrisPieceState</code>.</div><div><br /><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</span>The source code for the JaredAll/Tetris implementation can be found
