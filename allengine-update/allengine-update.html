&#9;The Allengine is the core of my personal projects from the last
year. It is the engine that powers my Tetris implementation. As its
sole creator and user, I have had complete architectural freedom in
its design. As such, it has been my greatest opportunity to apply the
object oriented, functional, and template techniques present in C++.

&#9;Allengine is a two dimensional game engine. Clients who utilize the
Allengine will typically maintain their game objects in a vector of an
implementation of the <code>GameComponent</code>
interface. The <code>GameComponent</code> is the building block for
game logic, as it outlines the methods which the engine calls in a
single update cycle. The <code>advance(
vector&lt;unique_ptr&lt;GameComponent&gt;&gt; components )</code> method handles
the render, input, and update logic for each engine cycle. This method
is a function template that will accept a vector of any implementation
of <code>GameComponent</code>; This allows the client's game to
maintain a vector of their game specific implementations, but still
utilize the engine to handle those implementations seamlessly. In this
case, the template is used to make a vector
of <code>GameComponent</code> implementations covariant with a vector
of <code>GameComponent</code>s. This could potentially lead to issues;
however, as long as the Engine class only reads from the vector, and
doesn't add to it, those issues will be avoided. I believe this sort
of in and out template structure is a first class citizen in the
Kotlin programming language. In any case, the Engine need not append
to the vector in order to handle the rendering, input, and updating
necessary for game play. 

&#9;The engine utilizes the <code>GameComponent</code> interface and
the <code>GameRenderer</code> to render each component's
constituent <code>RenderComponent</code>s. The <code>render(
vector&lt;unique_ptr&lt;GameComponent&gt;&gt; components )</code> function
template in the renderer invokes the <code>accept_renderer</code>
method required by the <code>GameComponent</code> interface. This
renderer method is a template in the same spirit as
the <code>Engine</code> class' advance method, and is used in the
Engine's advance method. The virtual <code>accept_renderer(
Game_Renderer& renderer )</code> method must be implemented to invoke
the renderer on a component's vector of <code>RenderComponent</code>
implementations. Usually, the update logic for a specific game
component will need access to an implementation
of <code>RenderComponent</code>'s interface. Thus, it is convenient to
maintain a vector of those implementations, rather than of the
interface; however, as the renderer will ideally be unaware of which
implementations are being rendered, it can only use the methods
outlined in the interface. We reuse the same template technique used
in the <code>Engine</code>'s <code>advance</code> method. In order for
the <code>render_all</code> method to generate the proper template
instantiations, the <code>render_all</code> method must be invoked on
a vector of each required <code>RenderComponent</code> implementation;
this is why each individual <code>GameComponent</code> implementation
must invoke the <code>render_all</code> method on its constituent
renderings. 

&#9;An example of <code>GameRenderer</code> use is in
the <code>PhysicsBall</code> class. The call to <code>render_all(
blocks );</code> generates a template instantiation
for <code>vector&lt;unique_ptr&lt;Sprite&gt;&gt;</code>. As <code>PhysicsBall</code>
is a descendant of <code>GameComponent</code>, the <code>Engine</code>
class can polymorphically
invoke <code>PhysicsBall</code>'s <code>accept_renderer</code>
implementation. The result is a client agnostic rendering framework.

&#9;In order to handle input, the <code>Engine</code> delegates to
an <code>InputHandler</code> class. This class packages up inputs
into <code>InputEvent</code>s, which are passed down to
those <code>GameComponent</code>s for
which <code>accepting_input()</code> returns true using
the <code>update( InputEvent&amp; )</code> method. Typically this has
been only a single component, the player's avatar, but any number
of <code>GameComponents</code> can accept input. For those components
not accepting input, the <code>Engine</code> invokes
the <code>update()</code> method. To illustrate a potential use of the
Allengine update architecture, Figure 1 includes a small client
architecture. The client's game maintains a vector
of <code>TestComponent</code>s, each of which can be parameterized by
a void function, set using the <code>on_update( function&lt;void()&gt;
delegate )</code> method, to be called when the engine updates. At
time of writing, there is only one subclass
of <code>TestComponent</code>; the <code>PhysicsBall</code>
class. However, for each additional client game component, a new
subclass of <code>TestComponent</code> would be created. To update
each component, the <code>Engine</code>'s <code>advance</code> method
is invoked upon the client's list
of <code>TestComponent</code>s. Again, the result is a client agnostic
updating framework; the client need only implement the appropriate
interfaces and invoke the appropriate methods.
