<p>&nbsp;</p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</span>In <i>Game Programming
Patterns,</i>&nbsp;Robert Nystrom recommends keeping all game
components in a single collection. This design makes it easier to
handle updating each component between frames; simply iterate over the
list, calling update on each component. This design is utilized in the
JaredAll/Tetris implementation. However, there are two different
domains in which a game component may be updated. The first is the
engine domain; this update is responsible for updating the state of
each individual Tetris component. The second is the Tetris domain, in
which the update is responsible for updating the relationships between
Tetris components. At what point should Tetris interactions between
the different Tetris specific game components be implemented? As these
are separate domains, their respective logic should be kept
separate. Additionally, the engine is only aware that each component
it is updating is a <code>GameComponent</code>. In order to update the
relationships between the Tetris constituents, the calling code must
have access to the Tetris specific interfaces. Enter the Visitor
pattern.

First, the <code>TetrisComponent</code>s are kept in a vector in
the <code>Game</code> class. In order to maintain cleanliness (and
follow the Open Close principle from good old Uncle Bob), updating each
<code>TetrisComponent</code> must be done in a uniform fashion. This
is achieved by having each <code>TetrisComponent</code> accept a
<code>TetrisVisitor</code>.<div><br /><div>&nbsp;

<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</span>Each implementation
of <code>TetrisComponent</code> invokes the visitor to visit
itself. This is demonstrated in the <code>TetrisPiece</code>
class. The <code>TetrisVisitor</code> must implement methods that
update each <code>TetrisComponent</code> implementation. Which
specific visitor method is invoked is determined dynamically, at
runtime. Since the concrete implementation
of <code>TetrisComponent</code> invokes the visitor, the visitor is
aware of that implementation's specific interface. In this way, the
visitor can update the pieces, the board, and the panels as pieces, a
board, and panels, without the <code>Game</code> ever being aware of
the implementations in its <code>TetrisComponent</code>
collection. With this design, the visitor is responsible for updating
the relationships between the different Tetris components. As the
engine is responsible for drawing each component, handling user input,
and so on, the <code>Game</code> class is responsible for maintaining
the necessary Tetris relationships, and it does so via
a <code>TetrisVisitor</code>.</div><div><br /></div><div>&nbsp;

<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</span>In the JaredAll/Tetris implementation, there is only one visitor in
use: the <code>TetrisVisitor</code>. However, as indicated in the UML,
this class implements the <code>ComponentVisitor</code> interface. As
of this post, there is no sound associated with the different Tetris
events. It would be possible to implement audio with another visitor,
perhaps a <code>TetrisAudioVisitor</code>. The <code>Game</code> would
then maintain a collection of <code>ComponentVisitor</code>s, and
invoke each on all of its <code>TetrisComponent</code>s. At that
point, which actual implementation would be invoked would depend on
two things: the implementation of the <code>TetrisComponent</code>,
and the implementation of the <code>ComponentVisitor</code>. This
technique is called <i>double dispatch</i>, as it takes two
polymorphic calls to determine which code is executed.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</span>The source code for the JaredAll/Tetris implementation can be found
